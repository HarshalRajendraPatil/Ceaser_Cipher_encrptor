This was uesd in ancient times when the people wanted to send the secrete message to other people and make sure that no one else understands it except the one who is receiving the message.
Each letter of the message is shifted by a specific amount entered by the user, and this was the way to encode the message
while decoding the message, the people use to shift backwards from the letter of the encoded message.
